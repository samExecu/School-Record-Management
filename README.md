# School's Record Management

## Installation

To use this program, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can download and install a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC).

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can compile the `main.c` file using the following command:

```
gcc -o school_records main.c
```

This will create an executable file named `school_records` that you can run.

## Usage

The program provides the following menu options:

1. **Add Records**: Allows you to add new student records, including the student's name, class, and roll number.
2. **View Records**: Displays all the student records stored in the `Student.dat` file.
3. **Search Records**: Allows you to search for a student's record by their name.
4. **Delete Records**: Allows you to delete a student's record by their roll number.
5. **Update Records**: Updates the class of students who are in class 10 to class 11.
9. **View Recycle Bin**: Displays the records that have been deleted and stored in the `Recycle Bin.dat` file.
0. **Exit**: Exits the program.

To use the program, simply run the `school_records` executable and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Note
This program was developed a year ago, and no further updates or changes are planned for the future.

## Testing

To test the program, you can run the executable and try out the various menu options. You can add, view, search, delete, and update student records, and also view the recycle bin.

You can also test the program by modifying the `main.c` file and recompiling it to see the changes in functionality.
